# Infor LN Constraint Language Support

This extension pack adds syntax highlighting and snippets for Infor LN Constraint Language.
It contains every language element based on the official Infor LN documentation as well as some legacy elements from the BaaN ERP system.

Sadly, the BaaN Board went down as of January 1st 2024, therefore the legacy elements are based on the partial documentation the creator of this extension pack has saved during his work with Infor LN's PCF module and it's constraints.
